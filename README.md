# Favourite Product Built
Of all the products I have built, **SPYDER** https://www.energytariffscheck.com/ , https://github.com/kukuu/SPYDER  stands out as my favourite due to its direct impact on democratising complex market intelligence. SPYDER is an AI-driven energy tariff comparison platform that ingeniously tackles a real-world problem: the opacity of energy pricing. By architecting a system that integrates Large Language Models to interpret intricate tariff structures and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline to provide accurate, cited insights, I led the creation of a real-time quoting engine. This solution automated a traditionally manual and error-prone consultancy process, empowering users to self-serve and find the best energy deals in seconds, thereby delivering tangible financial savings and driving a Net Zero initiative.

The project's success is rooted in its robust, scalable architecture built on a cloud-native AWS stack. It leverages containerised microservices and vector databases to process millions of data points, delivering personalised recommendations that dramatically improved conversion rates. This technical foundation was a direct precursor to the development of **"Ask JIM,"**  https://github.com/kukuu/ask-JIM/blob/main/README.md, an intelligent AI assistant. While SPYDER automated data analysis, Ask JIM was designed to operationalise that insight, providing a conversational interface for navigating and acting upon complex enterprise information. Together, they represent a powerful evolution: from building a system that finds answers to creating an autonomous agent that drives decision-making and action.

Ultimately, SPYDER embodies my core approach to engineering: applying advanced AI to solve pressing commercial challenges with a user-centric focus. It showcases my full-stack capability in designing, building, and leading the development of intelligent systems that are not only technologically sophisticated but also deliver measurable business value and positive social impact. The journey from the data-processing engine of SPYDER to the interactive agency of Ask JIM is a progression I am immensely proud of and eager to apply to new, complex challenges.
